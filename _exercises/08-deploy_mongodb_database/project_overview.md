# Project Overview: Color API and MongoDB Integration

Welcome to our project focused on persisting data from our Color API! ðŸŒˆ In this exercise, we'll be implementing a solution that connects our Color API to a MongoDB database, allowing color information to be stored and retrieved efficiently. 

### Overview
Before diving into the detailed steps, hereâ€™s a high-level summary of what youâ€™ll be working on:
1. Deploy a MongoDB Stateful Set with a headless service.
2. Create a persistent volume claim for dynamic volume provisioning in MiniCube.
3. Set up necessary config maps and secrets for database connection.
4. Update the Color API code to handle database connections through environment variables.
5. Utilize MongoDB for database interactions in the Color API.
6. Extend the REST API to include relevant paths for color data management.
7. Test the API using a NodePort service to interact with external users.

Take a moment to implement this solution on your own! You might be surprised at how much you can achieve without immediate guidance.

### Step-by-Step Guide
Now, let's break down the implementation into actionable steps:

1. **Deploy MongoDB Stateful Set**:
   - Create a Stateful Set that allows for persistent storage management.
   - Configure a headless service for internal communication between pods.

2. **Create Persistent Volume Claim**:
   - Set up a persistent volume claim to automatically provision storage using the standard storage class in MiniCube.

3. **Set Up Config Maps and Secrets**:
   - Create the required config maps and secrets for initializing and securely connecting to the MongoDB database.

4. **Update Color API Code**:
   - Modify the Color API to read database connection information from environment variables.
   - Implement MongoDB and Mongoose for database interactions in your API code.

5. **Extend REST API**:
   - Add GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods to manage colors.
   - Ensure correct responses according to the specified endpoints.

6. **Deploy NodePort Service**:
   - Create a NodePort service to expose the Color API to external users for testing.

7. **Testing**:
   - Use HTTP calls to test various endpoints of your REST API and see how it interacts with MongoDB.

### Conclusion
By completing this project, youâ€™ll gain valuable insights into deploying stateful applications using Kubernetes, managing persistent storage, and connecting APIs to databases. Remember, experimentation is key! ðŸŒŸ Keep practicing and exploring new concepts as you enhance your understanding of these technologies.

### Lecture Description
In this lecture, we cover the implementation of a MongoDB Stateful Set and the integration with a Color API, focusing on persistent data storage and management through a REST API. We will walk through essential concepts such as creating config maps, secrets, and modifying the API for database interactions in a MiniCube environment.
